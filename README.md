# Close Price Prediction for Stocks using LSTM

This project involves building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the closing prices of stocks based on historical data. It is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries like TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning and pandas for data manipulation.

## Key Steps
1. Importing necessary libraries and dependencies.
2. Loading and preprocessing the stock market dataset.
3. Implementing the LSTM model for stock price prediction.
4. Training the model on the dataset.
5. Predicting stock prices using the trained model.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Load the dataset in the required format.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Outputs
- Visualizations of the actual vs. predicted stock prices.
- Performance metrics such as RMSE or accuracy scores.

### Note:
Ensure the dataset used matches the structure expected by the notebook (e.g., date and close price columns). Adjust parameters like epochs and batch size for better results.
